# Responsive Portfolio
React.js app created to showcase my web development projects.

This application was styled using the [Bootstrap 4.5](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework, and is mobile responsive with breakpoints at 576px, 768px, 992px, and 1200px. I used the "Sketchy" [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) theme to customize the framework, and the background pattern is "Light Paper Fibers" from [Toptal Subtle Patterns](https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/).
